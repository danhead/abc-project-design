This time they installed under floor heating and also did the tiling. They go way above what they need to do, always making great suggestions. They even let me use there trade card at top tiles so I could save money. Would 100% recommend these guys.",

      "text": "Excellent, my mother's bathroom was gutted and refitted in 7 days. They tiled the necessary areas shower, the floor, a quadrant shower fitted, new sink and toilet fitted. A new ceiling with 4 spot lights and remaining walls plastered and painted. They also fitted a heated towel rail and mirrored cabinet. My mother was delighted and so was I to see her smile at her new bathroom. Worked cleanly and removed all the old bathroom. Very friendly and provided a quick quote. Would highly recommend.",
