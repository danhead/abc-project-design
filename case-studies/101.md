This medium sized bathroom in Maldon, Essex came with very few design problems.

The old bathroom was completely stripped out to a shell. The bathroom showed
small signs of damp which was easily rectified with a waterproof membrane
inserted within the shower walls.

The client decided to replace the old bath with a large walk-in shower. Client
chose to have a false ceiling installed with spot lights and an alcove with
electrics and lighting was fitted to give the bathroom a warm feeling.

We stripped out the old bathroom and disposed of all rubbish. We tiled, plastered
and painted the floor and walls, installed the new bathroom with tiling,
plastering, painting and all electrical works.

Total price for labour and building materials: £5,900.
