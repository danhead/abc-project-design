Very small bathroom in a block of flats In Hackney, E9.

Existing bathroom was extremely old. We stripped the bathroom back to the shell
and addressed damp issues.

Client went with our suggestion of using two different wall tiles.

Shower mixer was inserted in to wall to give the bathroom a modern, minimal feel.

Bathroom went from old and dated to fresh and modern.

Total price for labour and materials: £5,000.
(This does not include bathroom suite or tiles)
