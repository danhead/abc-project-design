The client needed 19 square meters of ceramic floor tiles fitted at short notice.

We first applied self leveling compound as the concrete floor was quite uneven. After 2 days to allow for the compound to completely dry, we returned to install the tiles.

The installation was completed in one day and the client was able to continue with the kitchen installation the following day.

The client provided the ceramic floor tiles and we provided the levelling compound, adhesive and grout.

Total price for labour and materials: £1,100.
