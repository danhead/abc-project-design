This room had old porcelain tiles, which we removed and disposed. We then applied self levelling compound to the floor and allowed to set for 24 hours.

All skirting and radiators were removed.

20 square meters of new tiles were laid and sealed for protection.

Total price for labour and materials: £2,100.
